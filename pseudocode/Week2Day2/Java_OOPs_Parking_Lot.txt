Pseudo-code Problem: Parking Lot Ticketing System
Concepts: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Method Overriding

class Vehicle
    attributes: vehicleNumber, entryTime
    method calculateFee(exitTime)
        return 0

class Car extends Vehicle
    override method calculateFee(exitTime)
        hours = ceil(exitTime - entryTime)
        fee = 50 + (hours-1) * 30
        return fee

class Bike extends Vehicle
    override method calculateFee(exitTime)
        hours = ceil(exitTime - entryTime)
        fee = 20 + (hours-1) * 10
        return fee

class Truck extends Vehicle
    override method calculateFee(exitTime)
        hours = ceil(exitTime - entryTime)
        fee = 100 + (hours-1) * 50
        return fee

System Flow:
- On entry: create object of Car/Bike/Truck with entryTime
- On exit: call calculateFee(exitTime)
- Print ticket: vehicleNumber, type, fee

Example Run:
car KA05AB1234 enters 10:00, exits 13:30 â†’ Fee = 125
