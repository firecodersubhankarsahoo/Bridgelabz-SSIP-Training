Pseudo-code Problem: Online Survey Report Generator
Concepts: groupingBy(), Aggregation, Averages

class SurveyResponse
    attributes: restaurantName, rating

method generateReport(responses)
    group = dictionary with restaurantName as key
    for each response in responses
        add response.rating to group[response.restaurantName]

    report = {}
    for restaurant in group
        avg = sum(group[restaurant]) / count(group[restaurant])
        report[restaurant] = avg

    highest = max(report.values())
    lowest = min(report.values())

    print("Average ratings:", report)
    print("Highest rated restaurant:", highest)
    print("Lowest rated restaurant:", lowest)

Example Run:
