Pseudo-code Problem: Hotel Room Reservation System
Concepts: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation

class Room
    attributes: roomNumber, customerName, daysStayed
    method calculateBill() â†’ return 0

class DeluxeRoom extends Room
    private rate = 3000
    override method calculateBill()
        return daysStayed * rate

class SuiteRoom extends Room
    private rate = 5000
    override method calculateBill()
        return daysStayed * rate

Example Run:
Ravi books DeluxeRoom for 3 nights
Output: Bill = 9000

Anita books SuiteRoom for 2 nights
Output: Bill = 10000
