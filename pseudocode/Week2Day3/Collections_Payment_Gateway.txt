Pseudo-code Problem: Payment Gateway Processor
Concepts: Generics, Polymorphism, Encapsulation

class Transaction<T>
    attribute: paymentDetails
    method processPayment()
        paymentDetails.process()

    method getTransactionDetails()
        return paymentDetails.toString()

class UPI
    attributes: upiId, amount, merchantName
    method process()
        print("Payment of ₹amount via UPI successful for merchantName")

class Card
    attributes: cardNumber, cvv, expiryDate, amount
    method process()
        print("Payment of ₹amount via Card ending cardNumber successful")

class NetBanking
    attributes: bankName, accountNumber, amount
    method process()
        print("Payment of ₹amount via NetBanking (bankName) successful")

Example Run:
Transaction<UPI> t1 = new Transaction<>(new UPI("user@upi",1200,"Amazon"))
t1.processPayment()

Transaction<Card> t2 = new Transaction<>(new Card("1234-5678-9876-5432","123","12/27",5000))
t2.processPayment()

Transaction<NetBanking> t3 = new Transaction<>(new NetBanking("HDFC","00112233",8000))
t3.processPayment()
